# Stochus

## Architectural Overview

## Getting up and running

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (you might want to install this via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Running the backend API

To start the backend, first you must ensure docker is running on your machine. Then, if the stochus containers aren't already running, run the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Once all containers are up and running, you can start the actual backend API by running

```shell
npx nx run backend:serve
```

This will also make OpenAPI documentation available at http://localhost:3333/docs. These do not reload automatically.

### Running the frontend

Run `npx nx run frontend:serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Pre-configured users

| Username               | Password   | Roles                              | Groups                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `admin`                | `admin`    | Keycloak admin, not a stochus user |                               |
| `student`              | `password` | student                            |                               |
| `mathmagician-student` | `password` | student                            | `mathmagicians`               |
| `multi-group-student`  | `password` | student                            | `mathmagicians`, `studie-abc` |
| `researcher`           | `password` | researcher                         |                               |

## Making changes to Keycloak (e.g. adding new users)

Once you've made a change to keycloak, you'll have to export the realm so the changes can be shared with other
developers. You can do this by running

```shell
./scripts/export-keycloak-realm.sh
```

This will update the JSON file in `./docker/keycloak/realms`, which must then be comitted. In order to ensure that the
export worked correctly, I strongly recommend you completely re-create your keycloak container as this will force an
import of the realm on startup. In order to do this, (while the docker containers are running) execute

```shell
./scripts/reset-keycloak-containers.sh
```

Alternatively, you can recreate all docker containers using the commands below. But watch out: this will also delete
your database!

```shell
docker compose down
docker compuse up -d
```

But please be advised: this will remove all of your containers!
